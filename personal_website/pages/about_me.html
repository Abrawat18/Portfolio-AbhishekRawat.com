                        </br>
                <p>I am a master student at Concordia University majoring in Software Engineering. With two career goals “Work with smart people so you learn from each other” and “Work to make products which makes you feel proud.” I started my undergraduate studies in Information Technology from Devi Ahilya University, one of the prime universities of India. My academic curriculum provided me with a preliminary knowledge in diverse field of computer science. The curiosity hence developed, has motivated me to enhance my core computing skills and knowledge, particularly in web technologies, software engineering, software design, mobile Interfaces and human computer interaction. My long term career objective is to become a software professional and get involved in the areas of my interest such as software design, mobile interfaces and software development. My ambition is to use my skills to innovate and bridge the gap between the physical human world and the computer world.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-8"></br>
                        <p>My study at the Devi Ahilya University in Information Technology was an amalgamation of the core conceptual subjects. There, I acquired the fundamental knowledge of computer science covering subjects like Engineering Mathematics, Computer Graphics, Web Engineering, Computer Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, Digital Computer Organization, Software Engineering, DBMS, Computer Networks, Theory of Computation and the likes. I also studied latest advanced developments on Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence.</p></div> 
                <div class="col-sm-4"><h2>Industry Experience</h2></div>
                <div class="col-sm-8"></br>
                <p>The first hand industry experience gained through working at Oracle further enhanced my interest towards designing user interfaces for mobile application. Here my responsibilities were to design and develop android and iOS based mobile banking applications. I also worked on web based Internet banking application. My tenure at Oracle allowed me to closely associate with larger databases, front end web technologies, back end data processing as well as the integration of a coherent user centric product, the prime target of which is to capture users by providing easiest ways to interact with the bank for a multitude of daily activities</p>
